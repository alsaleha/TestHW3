Comment => I have decided to update the way of presentation, which you can notice.
        => I have six group filters that can represent many different ways of the data. 
        => I face some technical difficulties but that encourages me to have some work-around and alternative solutions. 
        => I have helped Amandeep and some girls in the class. I talked to Brett just to have an overview and start.
        => I spent some time on this project, which I learned a lot and it is worth investigating.  
        => I would  like to have some documentation for how the user can get the beat of  it but that is a task for another day. 
        => I will be more than happy to hear any comments. 
        => There are some areas I need to improve like the radio button to be a drop down list but I decided to keep it for the improvement later in my free time.
